What is this repository?
---
This is a collection of projects I am building on the website FreeCodeCamp<br>
Starting with the Responsive Web Design with HTML and CSS, I aim to build a showcasing of what I've learned.<br>

JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures<br> 
[20/2/2025 -> CURRENT]
===
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/

I am currently learning JavaScript through freeCodeCamps lessons.<br>
As of current I have not completed any JavaScript projects yet.<br> 
When I do I will link them below as with the HTML projects.


JavaScript LESSON: building a RPG
---
Disclaimer:
Unlike my previous github projects, this is directly a FreeCodeCamp lesson.<br>
A freeCodeCamp Project offers a loose guideline and list of checks of what the learner should build, but leaves the actual programming to the learner<br>
A freeCodeCamp lesson is a railroaded coding session rather then an independent project, with a series of strict ordered checks (173 in this case) to ensure you are writing the code expected in order to learn the topic.<br>
As such I take no credit for the contents of this lesson.<br>
I am adding it to my repository as I may want to reference this code later, and it is a good showcase of combining HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
