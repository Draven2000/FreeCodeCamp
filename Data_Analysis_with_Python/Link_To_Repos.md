Data Analysis with Python<br> 
[20/2/2025 -> 11/3/2025]
===
With the completion of the Sea level predictor project, I have earned the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification. The link for my certification can be found here.<br>

Initially I was going to link my Data Analysis with Python project files here,
however, I found they are better suited to lie within their own individual repositories due to the project templates working from freeCodeCamp repositories.<br>
For clarity on the format of the projects, freeCodeCamp provided a Boiler template repository for each project. w
Each template contains a data file to be analysed, a test script file to ensure the code I write meets the expected requirements, a project file for me to input my code for the project, and a main code.py file for running the project file+Test together.

The code I have writtern may be distinguished from the template by the commits, and that the project file follows a naming convention of "projectname.py"
