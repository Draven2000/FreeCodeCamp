What is this repository?
---
This is a compilation of the many projects I am building on the website freeCodeCamp for the online courses<br>
Starting with the Responsive Web Design with HTML and CSS, I aim to build a showcasing of what I've learned.<br>

As of the 11th March, I have completed two certifications, 
* Responsive Web Design
* Data Analysis with Python

I am currently studying,
* JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures


Below I will list links to each of the projects I have completed.

Responsive Web Design Certification<br>
[4/12/2024 -> 20/2/2025]

https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Raven2000/responsive-web-design

The source code for each of my HTML projects may be found in this repository under the [Responsive Web Design folder](https://github.com/Draven2000/FreeCodeCamp/tree/main/Responsive_Web_Design).
Below I have listed preview links to view the HTML as a webpage.

To preview a HTML file uploaded to GitHub, prefix the url of the GitHub page with<br>

Data Analysis with Python<br> 
[20/2/2025 -> 11/3/2025]
===
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/

The link for my certification can be found here.<br>
https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Raven2000/data-analysis-with-python-v7
<br>
<br>
Initially I was going to link my Data Analysis with Python project files here,
however, I found they are better suited to lie within their own individual repositories due to the project templates working from freeCodeCamp repositories.<br>
Instead I have written a [read_me file](https://github.com/Draven2000/FreeCodeCamp/blob/main/Data_Analysis_with_Python/Link_To_Repos.md) in this repository linking to these other repositorys in the Data_Analysis_with_Python folder.

JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures<br> 
[20/2/2025 -> CURRENT]
===
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/

I am currently learning JavaScript through freeCodeCamps lessons.<br>

I will add the code to the Javascript folder of this repository and add preview links for the html page below as with the responsive web design projects.
