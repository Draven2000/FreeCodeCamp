A collection of projects I am building on the website FreeCodeCamp, starting with HTML.

JavaScript LESSON: building a RPG
---
Disclaimer:
Unlike my previous github projects, this is directly a FreeCodeCamp lesson.<br>
A freeCodeCamp Project offers a loose guideline and list of checks of what the learner should build, but leaves the actual programming to the learner<br>
A freeCodeCamp lesson is a railroaded coding session rather then an independent project, with a series of strict ordered checks (173 in this case) to ensure you are writing the code expected in order to learn the topic.<br>
As such I take no credit for the contents of this lesson.<br>
I am adding it to my repository as I may want to reference this code later, and it is a good showcase of combining HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
