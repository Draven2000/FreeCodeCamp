What is this repository?
---
This is a compilation of the many projects I am building on the website freeCodeCamp for the online courses<br>
Starting with the Responsive Web Design with HTML and CSS, I aim to build a showcasing of what I've learned.<br>

As of the 11th March, I have completed two certifications, 
* Responsive Web Design
* Data Analysis with Python

I am currently studying,
* JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures


Below I will list links to each of the projects I have completed.

Responsive Web Design Certification<br>
[4/12/2024 -> 20/2/2025]
===
https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Raven2000/responsive-web-design

The source code for each of my HTML projects may be found in this repository under the [Responsive Web Design folder](https://github.com/Draven2000/FreeCodeCamp/tree/main/Responsive_Web_Design).
Below I have listed preview links to view the HTML as a webpage.

Data Analysis with Python<br> 
[20/2/2025 -> 11/3/2025]
===
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/

The link for my certification can be found here.<br>
https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Raven2000/data-analysis-with-python-v7
<br>
<br>
Initially I was going to link my Data Analysis with Python project files here,
however, I found they are better suited to lie within their own individual repositories due to the project templates working from freeCodeCamp repositories.<br>
Instead I have written a [read_me file](https://github.com/Draven2000/FreeCodeCamp/blob/main/Data_Analysis_with_Python/Link_To_Repos.md) in this repository linking to these other repositorys in the Data_Analysis_with_Python folder.

Link to my certification:<br>

As with the responsive web design projects.<br>
The source code for each of my JavaScript projects may be found in this repository under the [JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures](https://github.com/Draven2000/FreeCodeCamp/tree/main/JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures) folder.
Below I have listed preview links to view the projects as a webpage.

https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Draven2000/FreeCodeCamp/blob/main/JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/build-a-pokemon-search-app.html

Currently the project I am most proud of, as both a project in a subject I am passionate about, and a culmination of the JavaScipt I have learned from this course.<br>
I went beyond the scope of the project to add additional functionality to the search app, including a levenshtein distance function that calculates the closest database name to the users search term, and prompts the user to click the link to this pokemons page. Useful for hard to spell pokemon such as Pyukumuku.<br>

Additionally, I ran functions that suggest what the user may be looking for, when the search term should be correct but doesn't specifically match the names in the provided dataset.<br>
For example, Deoxys is a perfectly valid pokemon name, but the database insists on calling deoxys-normal for its "base" form.<br>
So now, typing in deoxys will suggest a link to deoxys-normal page instead.<br>

Also, I included a Alt forms section of the page, when you search up a pokemon such as charizard, it is natural a user may want to see what other versions of charizard exist.<br>
i.e charizard-mega-x, charizard-mega-y, charizard-gmax.<br>
This additional page section finds pokemon that share a base name ("charizard") and pull them all up for the user to view.<br>
Also included are working link buttons that the user may click to bring up the page on these alt forms/suggested pokemon.<br>
I also included a "tips" modal that may be brought into view and hidden, making my app easier to use and understand.
